## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please send the details of any vulnerability found to [choopm](mailto:choopm@0pointer.org).

You should encrypt your message if possible.

Do *not* simply post a vulnerability as issue. These will be deleted.

After verifying the vulnerability there will be a new release within *7 days* usually.

We will always stay in contact during the development of a fix and
will atleast notify you that we received your disclosure.

We ask you to *not* share any details with 3rd parties within the 7 days embargo or exact time we tell you.

All vulnerabilities will be posted and made public at some point after the fix has been propagated.
The exact time depends on the type of vulnerability and it's potential consequences.
